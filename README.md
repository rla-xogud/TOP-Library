# TOP-Library

Basic application to keep track of books in a library. When complete it will have:
1. Add/delete books from library
2. Books store title, author, number of pages, and whether or not you have read the book


TODO:
1. Removing books removes from currently displayed library, but is still in the data structure so will be displayed again
2. Visuals need to be updated still (i.e. delete book button)
3. Add better way to make books. Maybe a form
4. Remove testing functionality.
